### Attributes 
- Attributes are pieces of data which we can use to describe the elements.
- There are lots of attributes in html. 
- All HTML elements can have attributes
- Attributes are always specified in the start tag
- Attributes usually come in name/value pairs like: name="value"
- Here are a few of the attributes of different HTML elements:
	- The href attribute of \<a> specifies the URL of the page the link goes to.
	- The src attribute of \<img> specifies the path to the image to be displayed
	- The width and height attributes of \<img> provide size information for images
	- The alt attribute of \<img> provides an alternate text for an image
	- The style attribute is used to add styles to an element, such as color, font, size, and more
	- The lang attribute of the \<html> tag declares the language of the Web page
	- The title attribute defines some extra information about an element
### Image Tag
- The HTML \<img> tag is used to embed an image in a web page.
- Images are not technically inserted into a web page; images are linked to web pages. 
- The \<img> tag creates a holding space for the referenced image.
- The \<img> tag is empty, it contains attributes only, and does not have a closing tag.
- The \<img> tag has two required attributes:
	- src: Specifies the path to the image
	- alt: Specifies an alternate text for the image <br>

### Comments
- If you want some text to be in the code file but do not want it to be displayed on the browser, you can hide it using html comments.
- You can use comments to document your source code.
- Syntax: \<!-- Write your comments here \-->
