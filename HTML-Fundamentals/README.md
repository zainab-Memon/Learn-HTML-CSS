## Images and Attributes 
- Attributes are pieces of data which we can use to describe the elements.
- There are lots of attributes in html. 
### Image Tag
- The HTML \<img> tag is used to embed an image in a web page.
- Images are not technically inserted into a web page; images are linked to web pages. 
- The \<img> tag creates a holding space for the referenced image.
- The \<img> tag is empty, it contains attributes only, and does not have a closing tag.
- The \<img> tag has two required attributes:
	- src: Specifies the path to the image
	- alt: Specifies an alternate text for the image
